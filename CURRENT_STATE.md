# CURRENT_STATE.md

Daily operational source of truth for REL8TION.

Last cleaned: 2026-06-04.

This file tracks what is currently implemented, partial, intended, risky, or still needs verification. It should be updated after production-flow changes. `AGENTS.md` is the Codex operating guide; `REL8TION_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` is the human architecture/product overview.

Status labels used in this file:

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` means code exists in the repo. It does not guarantee that the feature is deployed, live, passing RLS, or working with current Supabase production data.
- `[PARTIAL]` means some code exists, but the complete product behavior is not built or not fully wired.
- `[INTENDED]` means this is a REL8TION business/product rule or target architecture, not proof of current implementation.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` means the repo is not enough to prove live behavior, deployment, schema, RLS, or external service state.
- `[RISK]` means this can break demos, production data, security, SMS, or user trust if handled casually.

## DO THIS NEXT

- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Verify production routes after deploy.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test `/k` NFC routing priorities.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test Event Pass activation and Sponsored Event Pass consent.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test LO Coverage Sign setup/activation.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test `/event` buyer check-in, disclosures, SMS, and financing-help opt-in.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test Agent Dashboard and Loan Officer Dashboard visibility.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Test `/admin/agent-ranking` after Vercel deploy.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Verify Supabase migrations, RLS, and env vars.

## Current Code Anchor

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Production is configured to deploy from `main` through Vercel Git production branch automation.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Exact live SHA and aliases should be verified with Vercel inspection before making live claims.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `staging` exists as the preview/staging branch.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` The older direct deploy from `modular-claim-test` commit `51d2d1a` is historical only and preserved as tag `production-51d2d1a-2026-05-08`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Root `vercel.json` currently contains app rewrites, API rewrites, and cron entries including refresh/open-house data, outreach generation, mockup rendering, outreach sending, and Android inbox replay.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Root cron entries in code do not prove Vercel Cron execution, env vars, or production data effects.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Route guard scripts exist: run `npm run verify:routes` before route/API changes and `npm run verify:production-routes` after deployment.

## Current Product Rules

- `[INTENDED]` Event Pass is B2B open-house technology, not lead selling or referral purchasing.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Sponsored Event Pass requires per-event host-agent consent before sponsor visibility.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Loan Officer Coverage Signs stay with the loan officer and are separate from Sponsored Event Passes.
- `[INTENDED]` Buyer financing help is opt-in only when the buyer explicitly requests it.
- `[INTENDED]` Rel8tion does not collect borrower application data, SSN, income, assets, credit, borrower documents, or loan documents.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/k` is the universal NFC router and its routing priority is critical.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Printed Event Pass QR source of truth is `smart_sign_inventory.public_code`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `open_house_events.host_agent_slug` is the current event host field.
- `[RISK]` Root wrapper files and app files are not identical.

## Active Route State

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/k` routes NFC scans for keychains, front sign chips, rear sign chips, reset scans, pending sign activation, Event Pass flows, Loan Officer Coverage Sign flows, loan officer tags, backup keychains, and normal claimed agent keychains.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/claim` claims a Rel8tionChip/keychain into an agent identity. Event Pass profile completion must not show or process the public-profile keychain QR field.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/onboarding` is the post-claim agent setup page and includes smart sign activation entry points plus backup-keychain setup.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/agent-home` is the permanent owner dashboard for claimed agent NFC scans. Public/share QR profile behavior stays on `/b?agent=<slug>`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/sign-demo-activate` is the smart sign setup and listing binding flow.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/s` and `/sign` resolve smart sign public codes and route to activation or live event state.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/pass` resolves printed Event Pass QR inventory from `smart_sign_inventory.public_code`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/sponsored-pass-activate` activates reusable Sponsored Event Passes and records per-event agent consent before sponsor visibility.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/lo-sign`, `/lo-sign-setup`, and `/lo-sign-activate` support Loan Officer Coverage Sign setup, activation, and live routing.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/event` is the buyer smart sign check-in page with guided disclosures, optional financing-help routing, and SMS after local validation.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/event-chat` is the buyer return chat page for dashboard-triggered SMS links.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/agent-dashboard` is the live event dashboard for the host agent.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/loan-officer-dashboard` is the clean LO operations alias; `/lo-field-dashboard` remains a backward-compatible alias.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/nmb-activate` and `/nmb-verified` are loan officer tag/profile pages. Formal remote LO coverage management is not built.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/c/:code` and `/chip/:code` resolve printed Rel8tionChip QR inventory.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/a` redirects legacy/public profile traffic to `/b`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/b` is the public agent profile and lead capture path.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/get-open-house-kit`, `/kit-confirm`, and `/kit-intake` support the Open House Kit landing, NFC/keychain prefill, manual intake, and Stripe Checkout handoff.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/loan-officer-support` stores public loan-officer open-house-support requests and surfaces them in REL8TION COMMAND.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/key-reset` is a token-protected admin/beta reset utility, not a full admin dashboard.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/admin` is REL8TION COMMAND. It supports important operational workflows, but broader CRM edits, sign inventory edits, LO calendar/availability edits, billing automation, and full project controls are not complete.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/admin/agent-ranking` is an admin-only Agent Ranking / Production Intelligence module for permitted ListReports-style CSV imports, opportunity scoring, and manual outreach staging. It supports `agent_name`, `agent_company`, `agent_phone`, `listings_active_total`, `listings_days_since_last`, `listings_active_last_12_months`, `buyside_last_90_days`, and `buyside_last_12_months`. XLS/XLSX parsing, manual low-confidence match review, deployed route verification, and end-to-end upload testing remain `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]`.

## NFC, Sign, Event Pass, And QR State

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Front smart sign NFC is the buyer/check-in side and is stored as `uid_primary` with `primary_device_type = front_buyer_chip`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Rear smart sign NFC is the agent/dashboard challenge side and is stored as `uid_secondary` with `secondary_device_type = rear_agent_chip`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Rear sign scan requires an agent keychain challenge before dashboard access.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Agent sign activation requires the keychain handshake.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` A live smart sign is designed to attach to one active `open_house_events` row at a time.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Smart Sign and Event Pass may both be active for the same listing/open-house context because routing is device/sign-aware rather than listing-blocked.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Sponsored Event Pass activation GPS search includes the `20260531-eventpass-gps-search` focused near-me/today fallback.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Event Pass is gated as one included event unless renewed/reset by LO/admin. Reuse is blocked when prior event history exists and the pass is not live for that same event.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Loan Officer Coverage Sign activation uses a QR-only backing `smart_signs` row with a deterministic synthetic `uid_primary` so the current schema does not require a buyer NFC chip.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Printed agent Rel8tionChip QR rows redirect to `/b?agent=<slug>` when linked. NFC remains private owner access.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Printed loan-officer QR rows redirect to `/nmb-verified?slug=<lo_slug>` when linked. NFC remains private LO dashboard access.
- `[RISK]` Do not use `smart_signs.public_code` for new QR printing. It may exist only as a legacy smart-sign fallback.

## Buyer Check-In, Disclosures, And Financing

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/event` stores buyer check-ins in `event_checkins`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `/event` requires guided NYS/Rel8tion disclosure completion before check-in completion and SMS side effects.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Signed disclosure packet generation exists through `api/compliance/ny-disclosure.js`.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Signed disclosure PDF storage requires live Supabase Storage bucket and service-role env verification.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Buyer financing help is only routed when the buyer explicitly requests it. `pre_approved=false` alone is not enough to send financing outreach.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Buyer affordability/property-fit scenarios include annual property taxes and annual homeowners insurance as property expense fields, not borrower application data.
- `[PARTIAL]` `/b` saves buyer profile leads into `leads`; `/event` saves event attendance/check-ins into `event_checkins`. Treat `leads` as the global CRM/person path and `event_checkins` as event-specific attendance/action records until fully unified.

## Open House Kit And Website Promo

- `[PARTIAL]` `/get-open-house-kit`, `/kit-confirm`, `/kit-intake`, and `/api/checkout/open-house-kit` support Open House Kit acquisition, Event Pass keychain prefill, manual intake, and Stripe Checkout handoff.
- `[PARTIAL]` Successful Open House Kit Stripe returns can request `/api/checkout/website-promo` with a Checkout Session id to show a deterministic website-builder promo code for `https://my.rel8tion.me`.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Live Stripe secret/env deployment, product pricing, and webhook/fulfillment coverage still need verification before treating checkout as fully automated.

## Agent Website Builder

- `[PARTIAL]` `apps/agent-website-builder` contains the separate Next.js website-builder app formerly known as `v0-real-estate-agent-template`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Vercel project `v0-real-estate-agent-template` has been used for `https://my.rel8tion.me` and custom agent domains.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Website records live in `agent_websites`; site-owned listing records live in `agent_website_listings`.
- `[INTENDED]` Public agent sites should use `agent_website_listings` for agent-owned listings and should not republish broader `open_houses` inventory as MLS listing display.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Public agent sites include hero/headshot/about/gallery slots, agent-owned listings, listing details, contact forms, testimonials, mortgage calculator, and AI Studio surfaces.
- `[PARTIAL]` AI Studio includes preset-only headshot, listing staging, and AutoReel-style social video tooling.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` AutoReel quality, readable branding, voiceover pacing, and OpenAI/Sora job visibility should be verified against current production logs and generated outputs.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Current git tracking state for the website-builder folder must be checked before assuming all builder changes are committed.

## Listing, Enrichment, And Freshness

- `[PARTIAL]` Estately/Cheerio enrichment source exists in `estately-enrichment-worker.cjs` and `api/cron/enrich-agents.js`.
- `[PARTIAL]` OneKey listing freshness source exists in `onekey-freshness-worker.cjs` and `api/cron/refresh-open-house-data.js`.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Browserless/Trulia enrichment source was not found in tracked source during the repo audit. If that source is intended, it needs implementation or source recovery.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Live cron execution, RLS/write access, and data quality need verification before relying on automatic enrichment in production.
- `[RISK]` Enrichment can populate bad office numbers, stale listing facts, or wrong agent associations if parsing/validation is loose.

## Outreach And SMS

- `[PARTIAL]` `send-lead-sms` local source exists at `supabase/functions/send-lead-sms/index.ts` and uses the shared server-side SMS provider layer.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Deployed `send-lead-sms` source/version, provider env, and live delivery behavior still need Supabase/provider verification.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Outreach delivery-status storage exists through `agent_outreach_queue` delivery fields, `agent_outreach_delivery_events`, and the `twilio-message-status` callback function.
- `[PARTIAL]` Android SMS Gateway is used as a temporary outreach-volume fallback while preserving Twilio paths.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` The shared SMS layer supports route-scoped provider env vars: `SMS_OUTREACH_PROVIDER` for outreach/manual outreach and `SMS_EVENTS_PROVIDER` for buyer/event/owner operational traffic. Both fall back to `SMS_PROVIDER`.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Production outreach is split by brokerage and operator mode: Douglas Elliman outreach routes through Twilio/MMS; non-Douglas Elliman outreach waits for manual send when `outreach_operator_mode=live`; non-Douglas Elliman outreach routes through Android Gateway when `outreach_operator_mode=away`. Event/owner/system traffic remains on Twilio.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Runtime outreach operator mode is stored in `rel8tion_runtime_settings` and can be changed in REL8TION COMMAND with Live: manual / Away: Android controls.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Root cron code includes outreach generation and send endpoints. Outreach sending is throttled for provider safety: the send cron defaults to 20 per run, and the `send-agent-outreach` Edge Function hard-caps automatic sends with `OUTREACH_SEND_MAX_PER_RUN` defaulting to 20, `OUTREACH_SEND_MAX_PER_HOUR` defaulting to 20, and `OUTREACH_SEND_MAX_PER_DAY` defaulting to a hard ceiling of 150 per rolling 24 hours. Automatic initial sends do not require `approved_for_send=true`; eligible rows are `send_mode=automatic`, generated, rendered, due, with a listing photo and pending initial SMS copy.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` As of 2026-06-28, outreach follow-up/drip scheduling is disabled while opt-out health is recovered. Pending live follow-ups were marked `followup_send_status=not_scheduled`, `followup_send_at=null`, `followup_sms=null`, `followup_sms_link=null`, and `followup_block_reason=followups_disabled`; the generator and sender keep future follow-ups unscheduled until this is intentionally re-enabled.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` REL8TION COMMAND surfaces generated/rendered due outreach rows as Twilio ready, Manual ready, or Android ready and can explicitly Pause cron/Resume cron by changing `send_mode`. Do not reintroduce a hidden approval gate for normal cron sends without owner confirmation.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` REL8TION COMMAND outreach health treats an empty inbound window as quiet/normal instead of a broken inbox; it still warns on unlinked raw rows and fails only when linked replies are missing from the inbox view.
- `[PARTIAL]` Agent Ranking / Production Intelligence can stage ranked agents into `agent_outreach_queue` with `source=agent_ranking`, `send_mode=manual`, `initial_send_status=not_queued`, and follow-ups disabled. This is a review queue action, not an automatic sender.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` `docs/twilio-outreach-sms-runbook.md` is the durable Twilio outreach recovery/runbook document. Keep it in source control and update it whenever provider settings change.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` On 2026-06-23, Twilio SMS was restored with `SMS_PROVIDER=twilio` and `TWILIO_PHONE=+15168885461` in live Supabase secrets. Outbound smoke test queued from `+15168885461`, inbound reply to that number saved into `agent_outreach_replies`, owner alert queued, and the matched outreach queue row moved to `review_status=replied`.
- `[INTENDED]` Toll-free Twilio outreach can be evaluated later. Until then, do not send non-Douglas Elliman automated outreach through Twilio.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Twilio inbound outreach numbers should use the public `twilio-inbound-router` Edge Function as the incoming-message webhook. The router is deployed without JWT verification for Twilio, then forwards inbound replies into the protected `twilio-inbound-reply` handler with service-role auth. Matched replies link to outreach queue rows using tolerant 10/11-digit phone matching; unmatched replies are still stored with `queue_row_id=null` instead of being dropped.
- `[RISK]` In Twilio Messaging Service inbound settings, choose `Send a webhook`; `Receive the message` does not call REL8TION and makes replies disappear from Supabase even though Twilio stores them.
- `[RISK]` Delivery status callback URLs must use `twilio-message-status?token=<TWILIO_STATUS_CALLBACK_TOKEN>` with `POST`; do not use the inbound router for delivery status, and do not commit the token value.
- `[RISK]` Outreach sends real messages and can spend money. Verify filters, quiet hours, opt-outs, provider state, and owner approval before changing send behavior.
- `[RISK]` Android SMS Gateway/Tracfone outreach can be carrier-flagged if messages are sent in bursts. Do not raise outreach send caps without explicit owner approval and a provider health check.
- `[RISK]` Twilio/A2P campaign state has previously been reported as suspended. Treat Twilio delivery as unreliable until provider status is verified.

## Supabase, Schema, And RLS

- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Browser code uses the public anon key in app config and standalone pages.
- `[IMPLEMENTED]` Service-role serverless routes exist for Sponsored Event Pass, Loan Officer Coverage Sign, admin reset, admin actions, checkout, and selected privileged flows.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Live RLS policy state is not fully confirmed.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` Live schema and repo migrations must be checked before frontend assumptions are changed.
- `[NEEDS VERIFICATION]` RPC definitions used by app code but not proven from checked-in SQL include `find_nearest_open_house`, `queue_recent_outreach_candidates`, `verified_profiles_lookup`, and `verified_profiles_activate_or_create`.
- `[PARTIAL]` Agent Ranking / Production Intelligence migration source exists for `agent_production_uploads`, `agent_production_import_rows`, and `agent_rankings`. On 2026-06-28, the linked Supabase schema was applied with RLS enabled, service-role-only policies, ListReports activity columns, catalog verification, and filtered advisor verification for the new objects.
- `[RISK]` `event_loan_officer_sessions` grants and policies should be verified before broad public use.

## Current High-Risk Areas

- `[RISK]` `/k` routing order.
- `[RISK]` Smart sign activation sessions, especially stale rows.
- `[RISK]` Real field signs, including historically protected Elena/Galluzzo sign data, must not be detached or reset without explicit approval.
- `[RISK]` The historical beta lane identifiers in `AGENTS.md` should be verified against live rows before demo/reset use.
- `[RISK]` `open_house_events.host_agent_slug` versus stale `agent_slug` assumptions.
- `[RISK]` Smart sign QR inventory linking through `smart_sign_inventory`.
- `[RISK]` Rel8tionChip QR inventory linking through `rel8tion_chip_inventory`.
- `[RISK]` Buyer check-in SMS side effects and financing opt-in.
- `[RISK]` Outreach queue filters, quiet hours, opt-outs, and provider fallback.
- `[RISK]` Signed disclosure PDF storage and legal/form-version review.
- `[RISK]` WordPress files are local tracking only and not synced to production.

## Verification Commands

General:

```powershell
git status --short
rg "pattern"
rg --files
```

Routes:

```powershell
npm run verify:routes
npm run verify:production-routes
```

Static app:

```powershell
Set-Location apps/rel8tion-app
npm run dev
```

Mockup renderer:

```powershell
Set-Location apps/mockup-renderer
npm test
```

OneKey freshness dry-run:

```powershell
npm run refresh:onekey:dry-run -- --id=M00000489-971018
```

There is no confirmed full automated suite for the main static app. NFC/sign/Event Pass checks usually need manual route/state testing plus targeted Supabase row inspection.
